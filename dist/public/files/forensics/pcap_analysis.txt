PCAP Analysis Challenge
=======================

In a real challenge, this would be a .pcap file.

The capture contains HTTP traffic with the flag transmitted in a POST request.

Analysis steps:
1. Open in Wireshark
2. Filter: http.request.method == "POST"
3. Follow TCP stream
4. Look for form data or cookies

Example Wireshark filters:
- http contains "flag"
- http.request.uri contains "login"
- tcp.port == 80

The flag was sent in a POST to /api/submit:
POST /api/submit HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

flag=WOW{pc4p_4n4lys1s}
