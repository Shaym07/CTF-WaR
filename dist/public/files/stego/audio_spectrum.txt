Audio Spectrogram Challenge
===========================

In a real challenge, this would be a .wav or .mp3 file.

The flag is hidden in the spectrogram - visible when viewing frequencies over time.

Tools to use:
1. Audacity: View > Spectrogram
2. Sonic Visualiser
3. SoX: sox audio.wav -n spectrogram -o spec.png

The spectrogram shows text written in the frequency domain:
- Low frequencies: ~100-500 Hz
- Text visible: WOW{sp3ctr0gr4m}
